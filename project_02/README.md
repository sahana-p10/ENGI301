# Alarm Clock PCB 

This project is based off my project 1 for this class. It creates a PCB for the alarm clock portion. 

The repository includes a pdf schematic, all the EAGLE files (library, schematic, board), and additional manufacturing files such as CAM, gerbers, and bill of materials, in the MFG and implementation folder.
